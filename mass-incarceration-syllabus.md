# 1. Course Description

The US incarcerates more people than any other country on earth. This course examines *why* that is, and what are the *impacts* on people and communities. Students will learn about the policies and practices throughout the system that contribute to the growth of the people affected by the carceral system. Students will learn how individuals enter the system through policing and the court system, and what happens when they exit the system and try to make their lives on the outside. This all occurs against a contentious backdrop of local and national crime policies that fundamentally reshape communities.

In this course, the goal is for you to learn:

* The different -- and complex -- issues surrounding incarceration in the US.
* The broader context in which incarceration occurs.
* Various reform efforts and alternative institutions to address mass incarceration.

As well as:

* How to be a better writer.
* How to be a better public speaker.
* How to read critically.
* How to make a compelling argument.


# 2. Textbook & Readings

The following is a required textbook:

* Barlow, Hugh D. and David Kauzlarich. 2010. *Explaining Crime: A Primer in Criminological Theory*. Rowman & Littlefield.


The other readings will be posted for download on *Blackboard*. **Please print and bring your readings to class.**

# 3. Grading

This is how each of the assignments contributes to the overall course grade:

* Class participation (10%)
* Online participation (10%)
* Reading presentation (5%)
* Current events paper (15%)
* Debate (10%)
* Final paper (30%)
	- First draft (15%)
	- Outline (5%)

## Class participation & attendance

Your overall *class participation grade* is based on your participation and attendance. Good class participation involves coming to class prepared, attentive, and ready to speak up.

You are allowed 1 free absence over the course of the semester. Each additional absence will lower your participation grade by 1%. More than 5 absences mandate a failing grade for the course, unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as:

* An extended illness requiring hospitalization or visit to a physician (with documentation)
* A family emergency, e.g. serious illness (with written explanation)
* Observance of a religious holiday
	* Students will not be penalized for absences due to religious observance, but they must notify me at the beginning of the semester.

Students who must miss a class session should notify me by email ahead of time.

## Online Participation

We will use *Blackboard* to have online classroom discussion. **Each student will be required to post on 5 separate classes throughout the semester.** Each post will be graded according to: 

* Thoughtfullness/critical thinking
* Accuracy/course knowledge
* Spelling/grammar

An adequate post may be an original discussion, or can be a response to another student's post. Each post should be at least 1 paragraph long. Posts must be made prior to the class -- you can't go back and make posts on old discussions (for credit).

## Reading Presentation

Each student will be required to give one 5-10 minute presentation on a reading. The first day, we will schedule presentations. A presentation must:

* Summarize the main points of the reading
* Critically evaluate the reading
	- Do you agree or disagree with it?
	- Is there anything missing in the discussion?
	- How does it line up with other things you know about the world
* Pose 2 discussion questions for the rest of the class to tackle

## Other assignments

The current events paper, debate, and final paper (including first draft and outline), will be explained later.

# 4. Course Policies

* Class starts on time, lateness will affect your participation grade.
* Electronic devices (phones/laptops/tablets) off during class. If you have an special circumstance that requires you to use one, come discuss it with me ahead of time.
* Check your email regularly.
* If you have a question, check the syllabus or the assignment sheet first, before emailing me.
* Please print and bring readings to class.
* Do all the readings before class (Note, check the syllabus for the assinged page numbers - the .pdf files may contain more pages than are assigned).

*Note: I am not a lawyer. Nothing in this class constitutes legal advice. It's a course on various sociological and political issues related to the criminal justice system. For legal advice, one should consult an attorney or legal aid service.*


## Classroom Discussion Policies

CUNY is committed to creating a diverse and welcoming learning environment for all students and has a non-discrimination policy that reflects this philosophy. The classroom should be a comfortable space that encourages the participation of everyone. With this goal in mind, we can agree and disagree about ideas and theories to our heart’s content – that is the heart and soul of learning. We will not, however, tolerate personal attacks, or blatant sexist, racist, homophobic, or antagonistic language in the classroom. Be provocative, make us think - but don’t insult each other or your instructor.

## Plagiarism and Academic Integrity

Students who cheat or attempt to cheat will automatically receive a zero for that exam or paper. In addition, the incident will be reported in writing to the Dean so they may decide whether further disciplinary action is needed. Your short papers will be submitted to turnitin.com, an anti-plagiarism website that will notice if you submit papers copied from other students, from books or articles, or from the web.

## Disability Policy

It is college policy to provide reasonable accomodations to students with disabilities. Any student with a disability who may need accomodations in this case is advised to contact **accessibility@slu.cuny.edu** as early in the semester as possible. All discussions will remain confidential.

## The SLU Writing Center

Seeking out feedback on a writing project is the mark of an advanced writer, and writing center use is strongly correlated with successful completion of academic programs. At the SLU Writing Center, professional writing consultants are available to work with students at any stage of the writing process and at any point in the semester.

**Students can make a Writing Center appointment by visiting our website -  writingcenter.commons.gc.cuny.edu**.

There are four ways to connect with consultants:

1. In-person appointments. Come to the Writing Center to meet with a consultant face-to-face.
2. Phone appointments. Phone appointments are a good option for lunch (or dinner) hour consultations.  If you would like to make a phone appointment, 1) select "meet online" in the first drop-down on our online schedule 2) Enter your phone number 3) At your appointment time, log into your appointment and click on "start or join online consultation." Doing this will allow you to share your work with your Consultant and share a screen as you work through it together. (If you will not have access to a computer, that's ok; you can still have a phone appointment.)
3. Online sessions. To schedule an online chat session, select the option “Yes – Schedule Online Appointment.” When it is time for your appointment (or a few minutes before), log onto murphy.mywconline.com, open your appointment, and click on “Start or join online consultation.”
4. Written Feedback allows students to submit a paper to the Writing Center and receive written feedback on the paper within two business days of submission. To submit a paper for written feedback, select the Written Feedback calendar from the “choose a schedule” drop-down to the left, then click on the box for the day to attach your paper.
