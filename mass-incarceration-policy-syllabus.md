# 1. Course Description

The US incarcerates more people than any other country on earth. This course examines how this reality is shaped through public policy, and what is necessary to change it. This course will use the case of mass incarceration to explore the specific drivers of criminal justice policy, but also the factors that shape public policy more generally -- legislation, entrenched bureaucracies, organizational cultures, politics, public opinion, political economy, and others. Students will learn about the obstacles that these factors create, as well as theories and examples of how to transcend them. Students will gain knowledge of the breadth of the cycles of mass incarceration, what Michelle Alexander calls the phases of the "round-up" into the system, the "formal control" when people are inside, and the "invisible punishment" that lingers as people with the mark of a criminal record are released. With an understanding of these interlocking systems, students will explore entry points for transformation of the system.


# 2. Textbook & Readings

Students should acquire a copy of the following books:

* Alexander, Michelle. 2012. *The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness*. Revised edition. New York: New Press.

# 3. Grading

This is how each of the assignments contributes to the overall course grade:

* Class participation (10%)
* Reading responses (50%)
* Debate (10%)
* Policy paper (30%)

## Class participation

Your overall *class participation grade* is based on your participation and attendance. Good class participation involves coming to class prepared, attentive, and ready to speak up.

Students who must miss a class session should notify me by email ahead of time.

## Reading Responses

A large portion of your grade for this class will be based on your weekly reading responses. Reading carefully is an important skill. Just as important, is learning how to clearly communicate what you’ve read to others. In this class, your writing will serve as the primary "test" of your efforts to grasp the ideas presented. 

**You must complete 5 of these over the course of the semester.** For each response, you are expected to write a paper that critically analyzes the readings assigned. These papers should all roughly follow the same format. Below you will find an outline of what is expected -- both in terms of mechanics and in terms of content. Be sure to refer to it every week.

**Mechanics**

* Papers must be between 800 words and 1,000 words.
* Papers must be typed or word-processed; double-spaced and in 12 point type.
* Your name must appear, and pages must be numbered.
* Any direct quotations, paraphrases, or uses of others’ ideas (from either the readings assigned or elsewhere) must be cited in a consistent citation format of your choice.  
* You must include a reference list.
* Responses may focus on one of the week's readings or synthesize multiple readings in a week. **You cannot do multiple responses within a single week.**
* Email me your response before the start of class. 

**Content**

* The first paragraph (or two) should summarize the key arguments in the assigned reading. The remainder of the paper should critically analyze the reading. This means:
	* You should critically evaluate the arguments and theories presented, telling your reader what is good, what is bad, and what is missing from them. Give examples from readings to support your case.
	* You should critically evaluate the evidence or the logical form of the argument that the authors present in support of their theoretical argument. Does the evidence support the claims? How? Why not? Give examples to support your case.
	* You should provide a conclusion that indicates what is most valuable or most problematic about the arguments presented in the chapters. Give examples from readings to support your case.
* You may either present your analysis as a series of separate paragraphs touching on each of these points or you may address them simultaneously. But your ultimate goal should be to present your own argument as a coherent, well-developed and logical whole.


## Debate

We will hold a policy debate in class. We will choose a topic together, and then teams will be randomly assigned. Students will learn how to argue their point in a convincing way -- even if it may not align with their own opinion.

## Policy Paper

The final paper is an evaluation of a criminal justice policy. Students will take a specific policy and evaluate its merits and weaknesses. They will bring evidence and argumentation to bear on the policy, and make the case for the policy's implementation, repeal, or alteration. This paper will be from 5,000 - 6,000 words, and draw upon a variety of sources. In preparation for the paper, the student conduct at least one 30-minute interview with a policy-shaper or stakeholder on the topic. 

**CUNY Grading System:**

* *Undergraduate*
	* **A** (93-100), **A-** (90-92.9), **B+** (87-89.9), **B** (83-86.9), **B-** (80-82.9), **C+** (77-79.9), **C** (73-76.9), **C-** (70-72.9), **D** (60-69.9), **F** (0-59.9)

# 4. Course Policies

* Class starts on time, lateness will affect your participation grade.
* Check your email regularly.
* If you have a question, check the syllabus or the assignment sheet first, before emailing me.
* Please print and bring readings to class.
* Do all the readings before class (Note, check the syllabus for the assinged page numbers -- the .pdf files may contain more pages than are assigned).
* Late assignments will receive -5% and an additional -1% for each additional day.

*Note: I am not a lawyer. Nothing in this class constitutes legal advice. It's a course on various sociological and political issues related to the criminal justice system. For legal advice, one should consult an attorney or legal aid service.*


## Classroom Discussion Policies

CUNY is committed to creating a diverse and welcoming learning environment for all students and has a non-discrimination policy that reflects this philosophy. The classroom should be a comfortable space that encourages the participation of everyone. With this goal in mind, we can agree and disagree about ideas and theories to our heart’s content – that is the heart and soul of learning. We will not, however, tolerate personal attacks, or blatant sexist, racist, homophobic, or antagonistic language in the classroom. Be provocative, make us think - but don’t insult each other or your instructor.

## Plagiarism and Academic Integrity

Students who cheat or attempt to cheat will automatically receive a zero for that exam or paper. In addition, the incident will be reported in writing to the Dean so they may decide whether further disciplinary action is needed. Your short papers will be submitted to turnitin.com, an anti-plagiarism website that will notice if you submit papers copied from other students, from books or articles, or from the web.

## Disability Policy

It is college policy to provide reasonable accomodations to students with disabilities. Any student with a disability who may need accomodations in this case is advised to contact **accessibility@slu.cuny.edu** as early in the semester as possible. All discussions will remain confidential.

## The SLU Writing Center

Seeking out feedback on a writing project is the mark of an advanced writer, and writing center use is strongly correlated with successful completion of academic programs. At the SLU Writing Center, professional writing consultants are available to work with students at any stage of the writing process and at any point in the semester.

**Students can make a Writing Center appointment by visiting our website -  writingcenter.commons.gc.cuny.edu**.

There are four ways to connect with consultants:

1. In-person appointments. Come to the Writing Center to meet with a consultant face-to-face.
2. Phone appointments. Phone appointments are a good option for lunch (or dinner) hour consultations.  If you would like to make a phone appointment, 1) select "meet online" in the first drop-down on our online schedule 2) Enter your phone number 3) At your appointment time, log into your appointment and click on "start or join online consultation." Doing this will allow you to share your work with your Consultant and share a screen as you work through it together. (If you will not have access to a computer, that's ok; you can still have a phone appointment.)
3. Online sessions. To schedule an online chat session, select the option “Yes – Schedule Online Appointment.” When it is time for your appointment (or a few minutes before), log onto murphy.mywconline.com, open your appointment, and click on “Start or join online consultation.”
4. Written Feedback allows students to submit a paper to the Writing Center and receive written feedback on the paper within two business days of submission. To submit a paper for written feedback, select the Written Feedback calendar from the “choose a schedule” drop-down to the left, then click on the box for the day to attach your paper.
